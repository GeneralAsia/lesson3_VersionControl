            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this lesson we learned about the importance of version control and why most every company uses it. First off version control is when whatever program you are using saves every iteration of the program you are working on. For example, Cloud 9 has a feature that keeps track of every edit you make on a timeline that you can scroll through and go back to. This is extremely important because if something is changed in the code that corrupts or completely breaks the program you can go to when it was working. Same for if you lose the file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">During this lesson we also learned what git commands are and when to use them. Git commands are commands that communicate with the GitHub server that acts as a virtual shopping cart. By saying something like “git add” adds packets to your “cart”. While a command like “git commit” will store those packets into your repository, then you push it onto the live servers with the command “git push”. Likewise a way to download or retrieve information you would use the command git pull. Think of it like all the information being in the cloud and you have to push it up there to upload and pull it down to download it to your computer.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What it is like without version control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">During learning about what version control was we also learned about what it would be like if you were to work at a company that didn’t use version control. Say that you are working in an office and you are working on this program that calculates the average temperature of the office or something like that, and after working tirelessly on it for the past 5 hours you finally save it. But while you were doing that one of your other co-workers was also tampering with the file and saved their progress a little bit after you saved yours. All of the work you just did now means nothing since it got overwritten. That is why having version control is so important.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While working on this lesson we as a class were introduced to GitHub and what it is and how other coders like ourselves use it. GitHub is a cloud-based repository system for people to upload their code online. It is commonly used to share open source code that people have worked on so that others can work on it or for other people to use it. Before this class I had used GitHub before to download a Steam skin overlay for the basic user interface. And every month or so the author would upload updates to it through GitHub so it would work.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local vs. Remote</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">During lesson three we also were taught about the differences between Local Repositories and Remote Repositories. A Local Repository is a database or file system that is on your computer or device. Think about it like having your money in your wallet. No matter where you are as long as you have your wallet you can access that money. A Remote Repository is a database that is on the internet or cloud that you access remotely from most any device.  You could think of this as your bank account and your credit card. The bank has your money that you can access from anywhere.</p>
